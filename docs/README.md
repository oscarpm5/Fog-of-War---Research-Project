# Introduction
In this document we will take a look at what is Fog ow War, the different aproaches used in videogames, the different types of fog of war tat exist and we will finally explain how to implement it in our own videogame using some exercises to better comprehend the process.

## Terminology - What is Fog of War?
Fog of war, FoW from now on, is a term used in armed conflicts that was first described in the book "The Fog of War" by Carl von Clausewitz. The expression was later used by generals during the 1st and the 2nd World War and refers to the uncertainty in situational awareness (that is the perception of environmental elements and events, the comprehension of their meaning, and the projection of their future status) experienced by participants in military operations.

In videogames this expression is used to describe unexplored or hidden terrain or map areas. It is mostly used in strategy and roleplay videogames: the former uses it to hide information about what other players are doing and thus making the game more interesting by forcing the player to take risks, gather intel or predict what others might do. The latter uses FoW to tell the players that, although they might have discovered a certain area of the playable map, they still have much more to discover and thus encourage exploration.

## Types
With only two basic parameters we can define almost every videogame's FoW:

### Fog / Fog & Shroud
This first parameter depends on the kind of videogame we are willing to make and its intended features. Basically, games with FoW can be divided into two: the ones with only fog and the ones with fog and shroud.
The ones with only fog are the ones that do not care so much about exploring, they instead focus on hidding information. As a player you see all the terrain but you cannot see the enemies or buidings, or at least not in real time but a representation of their state the last tile you saw that area.

An example of a game that consist ony of visible areas and foggy areas is League of Legends. It comes up with two interesting additions to the system: bushes that are always fogged from the outside and wards that clear vision for you.

### Chunky / Smooth
The second parameter will let us define how our FoW looks and feels.
- **Chunky Fog:** The Chunky fog is the easiest to implement. It consists
